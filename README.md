YELLOW ILLUSION PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS: THE OBSCURE SH-T (<- sorry 'bout that title, at least i censored it tho). 

yeah that's right this is the obscure place where my own obscure ROM hacks and projects reside. there are only a few at this time (and it shows, indeed), but you can be sure to check on this page at an occaisonal time, perhaps even favourite it or give it a star. there may be more of my obscure classics coming soon. 

Yellow Illusion Productions is also on YouTube as "ZBHere". i know ZBHere is completely different but i'm still the same person there, and i occaisonally upload some gameplays of my own ROM hacks that are coming here soon, among other (mainly gaming-related) things. be sure to check it out and subscribe to ZBHere if you want.
